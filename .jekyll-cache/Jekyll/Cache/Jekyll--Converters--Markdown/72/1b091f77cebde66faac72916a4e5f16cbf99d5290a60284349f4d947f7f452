<strong>Partition of graphs with high minimum degree</strong> <br />

<summary><font color="#6d9eeb"><u>Abstract(Click to expand)</u></font></summary>
In 2003, Kuhn and Osthus showed that for every number $k$, every graph with minimum degree at least $l(k)=3\times 2^{11}\times k^2$ can be partition into none-empty sets $S$ and $T$, such that both $G[S]$ and $G[T]$ has minimum degree at least $k$, and each vertex of $S$ has at least $k$ neighbors in $T$.  We improve this result by showing that it is true for $l(k)=100k$ when $k$ is sufficiently large. This is joint work with Jie Ma from University of Science and Technology of China.
