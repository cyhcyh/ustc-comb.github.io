An archetype problem in extremal combinatorics is to study the structure of subgraphs appearing in different classes of (hyper)graphs. We will focus on such embedding problems in ‚Äúrandom like‚Äù graphs. In practice, we will mention ramsey-turan problems and related results.

<strong>Perfect Matchings in hypergraphs <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV12g411Y78G">video</a></strong> <br />

Matchings are fundamental objects in the study of graph theory. Unlike in graphs, finding maximum matchings in general hypergraphs is NP-hard -- its decision problem is actually one of the Karp‚Äôs 21 NP-complete problems in 1972. Here we shall introduce some recent developments on perfect matchings in hypergraphs from both the extremal and the computational aspects in the past decade.
