- title: Perfect Matchings in hypergraphs
  year: 2022
  date: Thursday (Sep 29, 2022), 3-4 pm
  abstract: Matchings are fundamental objects in the study of graph theory. Unlike in graphs, finding maximum matchings in general hypergraphs is NP-hard -- its decision problem is actually one of the Karpâ€™s 21 NP-complete problems in 1972. Here we shall introduce some recent developments on perfect matchings in hypergraphs from both the extremal and the computational aspects in the past decade.
